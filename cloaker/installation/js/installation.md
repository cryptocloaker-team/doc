## Generic installation 🛠

{% hint style="info" %}
**What if you need to use different campaign with the same JS installation? 🤔**  
You can make a generic one. You'll pass the campaign ID in your URL instead of in the code.

* in the JS code, remove your campaign ID: Remove "?c=XXX" part
* instead pass your campaign ID in your campaign URL. You can use either:
  * ?utm\_campaign=XXX 
  * or ?campaign=XXX
  * or ?c=XXX
