## **JS cloaking**

### **What are the benefits ?**

* use on any website. You just need to be able to place a JS tag.
* Our JS cloaking is unique because it's hybrid. \( no fingerprint \)  

### What are the downside

* There is a request to your domain \( unlike DNS where it's invisible \) 

### How to use it  📖

* [copy paste your installation code in your page](installation.md) 📋
* [optionally, proxy the JS with your own domain]() 🌐

### How it works 🕵️‍♀️

The fingerprinting code is only injected if visitor pass server side check.
