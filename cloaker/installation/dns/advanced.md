# ðŸ‘» Shadow mode

**Shadow mode or generic mode**

By default you pass your campaign ID in your campaign Link. If you want to hide that campaign ID from your campaign Link, you can use shadow mode

This is the default mode. Notice the `CONST CAMPAIGN="*"`

In generic mode you are passing the campaign ID in your campaign URL. You can use one of these parameters to pass it.

* utm\_campaign=XXX 
* campaign=XXX
* c=XXX

We believe that passing the campaign ID with **utm\_campaign** is safe, as most of the website are using these UTM with google analytics.

## Shadow mode ðŸ‘»

By default the cloaker recognize the campaign from the URL. You have nothing to do.

{% hint style="info" %}
It only works if you use a unique URL per campaign. \( subdomain or path \).

example

#### with subdomain

* sub1.domain.com   ==&gt; Campaign 1
* sub2.domain.com   ==&gt; Campaign 2
* ...

#### with path

* domain.com/path1   ==&gt; Campaign 1
* domain.com/path2   ==&gt; Campaign 2
* ...
{% endhint %}
