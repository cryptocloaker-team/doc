## Score 💯

The reason is that there are actually a lot of parameters about your visitors, that might make little sense to you, but is relevant for us. In our backend, we have all the data and with ML we spot fake traffic patterns and score your traffic. 🤖

So instead, you choose a traffic score, and we adjust settings accordingly. 🦾

You can see below the list of the score and what filter is turned on or off at each score level.
