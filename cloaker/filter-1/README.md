Filter table let you set the traffic score and broad filter settings.

For each filter, you either allow ‚úÖ \( = whitelist \), or disallow ‚ùå \( = blacklist \).

* When setting a whitelist ‚úÖ, only this type of users will be valid traffic. \( "only visitors from UK are allowed" \) 
* When setting a blacklist ‚ùå, this type of users will be invalid. \( "visitors from UK are not allowed, but other countries are allowed" \) 

When you only see one option, it's **allow** by default

For clarity, we grouped filter in three categories. You can read more about them in separate doc.

**connection** ‚Äî Check the visitor connection: IP, ISP, ASN, referrer, url

**location** ‚Äî Check the visitor location: timezone, country, region, city

**device** ‚Äî check the visitor device: device type, os, browser, language
