## referer 🔙

> When visiting a web page, the _referrer_ or referring page is the URL of the previous webpage from which a link was followed. More generally, a _referrer_ is the URL of a previous item which led to this request

It's very easy to spoof the referer, and also not reliable \( referer will be blank if you go from http to https \).  
While we make this filter available, we don't recommend using it.

{% hint style="danger" %}
referer filter doesn't work in JS mode
{% endhint %}
