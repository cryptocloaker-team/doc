# 🚀 Quick start

## How to install 🛠

There are two ways to install the cloaker. It depends of what kind of safe pages you are using

* If it's a custom domain or website, it's DNS cloaking. We install the cloaker at the domain level, on your Cloudlflare account.
* If you are using a third-party service like shopify, Wix, Squarespace... it's JS cloaking. You place our JS code on your safe site.

## How the dashboard works 👩‍💻

* At the top, you have the **table** or tabs
* on the left side, you have **views**. Views are just a way to hide and order the fields. You can change it the way you want.
